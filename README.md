RuzzleSolver
============

Project I worked on for fun to cheat in the iPhone word game "Ruzzle." To run, run through the main class. Note: it may take a couple seconds for a window to pop up, just be patient :)

Ruzzle is an iPhone 2-player word game, where users compete online with their friends or with strangers. A 4x4 character word puzzle is displayed and the goal of the game is to form as many words as possible in the alotted time in order to defeat your opponent.
I create a Java program where the user can input the 4x4 character grid and receive a list of all possible words that can be form sorted from greatest word count to smallest word count.
